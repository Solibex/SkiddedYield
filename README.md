# WindowsYield

WindowsYield is an advanced script executor with additional bypasses that enhance its functionality compared to traditional script executors like Infinite Yield. It provides several bypasses to overcome common limitations and restrictions imposed by Roblox.

## Features

- **CollectGarbage/GCInfo Bypass (Realistic):** WindowsYield incorporates a bypass for CollectGarbage and GCInfo functions, allowing you to manipulate and control memory usage more effectively. This bypass provides a realistic approach to memory management in Roblox bull crap you didn't even code this 🤣🤣 you just executed the adonis bypass and dex bypasses loadstring

- **Memory Spoofer (Realistic):** With the Memory Spoofer bypass, WindowsYield can modify and manipulate memory usage. This bypass adds another layer of realism to memory-related operations. This doesn't even have anything to do with memory 🤣🤣 except the adonis bypass and dex bypasses

- **DecendantAdded Bypass:** The DecendantAdded bypass allows WindowsYield to bypass the normal checks and restrictions imposed when manipulating or accessing objects in the game hierarchy. This bypass gives you more freedom and flexibility in interacting with the game's objects. oh no!!1!  it will help me protected!!! (literally gets detected on load, broken with one line)

- **ContentProvider Bypass:** The ContentProvider bypass in WindowsYield overcomes the limitations set by Roblox's ContentProvider service. It randomizes the preloading process for CoreGui and game assets, providing a more efficient and flexible way to preload assets without triggering detection mechanisms. ?? doesn't relate to anything at all but the the adonis bypass and dex bypasses loadstring does

- **GetFocusedTextBox Bypass (Lego Hacker):** WindowsYield includes a bypass for the GetFocusedTextBox function in the UserInputService, allowing you to retrieve the focused TextBox even in cases where it's protected or inaccessible. This bypass expands the capabilities of script execution and interaction with user input. Lego hacker?? 🤣 im laughing my ass off the dex bypass loadstring does that not the actual script itself

- **NewProxy Bypass (Lego Hacker):** The NewProxy bypass in WindowsYield enables you to create proxies without triggering detection mechanisms. This bypass adds an extra layer of stealth and security to your scripting activities. again with the legohacker LMAO dex bypass loadstring again
## - **Shit script:** we offer you zero protection! we use game.CoreGui which can be detected instantly! there's nothing that isn't pasted!! we only load loadstrings!!
